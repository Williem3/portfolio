Objective:
  Provide visitor to portfolio website with the ability to quickly access the owners about me, projects, skills, and resume information.
  This information should be relevant to the owner's job search.
  Owner should be able to update the skills and resume information dynamically by storing the skills and resume information in a database. 
  

TODO:
  Find a way to dynamically create delete buttons through ajax code and functionally delete the skill(s) from the database. 
  Create a separate page and entity for visitors so they can go to such page and mess around with the ability to create/read/delete images.
  Create an update function so that you may update existing skills with their logos or skill name. Ajax method for the delete should work similarly. 
  Update About Me page with final draft of what should be there.
  Begin adding projects to the portfolio page and change the dropdown to be direct links to the projects for testing purposes.

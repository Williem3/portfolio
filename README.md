# Portfolio Website

My portfolio website may be accessed through http://williemangram.com.

This project was intended to bring together all that I have learned in the time that I started studying programming in January of 2019. 

This project includes technologies such as:

    *  AJax
    
    *  Javascript
    
    *  SQL
    
    *  Java
    
    *  Spring Framework (Spring Boot)
    
    *  Hibernate
    
    *  HTML
    
    *  CSS
    
    *  JQuery
    
    *  Maven
    
    *  Spring Mail
    
I required myself to learn new technologies while working on this project to be able to get the functions that I wanted to work the way I intended. These include Ajax, Javascript, and JQuery.


I would like to give proper credit to https://html5up.net/ they provide multiple free to use frontend designs to be used by the public free of charge. I used a template called EscapeVelocity and edited it according to how I preferred. 

## Features

Ability to update resume through RESTful endpoints handled through Ajax.

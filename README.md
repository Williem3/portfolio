# Portfolio Website

My portfolio website may be accessed through http://williemangram.com.

This project was intended to bring together all that I have learned in the time that I started studying programming in January of 2019. 
This project includes technologies such as:

    *  AJax
    
    *  Javascript
    
    *  SQL
    
    *  Java
    
    *  Spring Framework (Spring Boot)
    
    *  Hibernate
    
    *  HTML
    
    *  CSS
    
    *  JQuery
    
    *  Maven
    
    *  Spring Mail
    
I required myself to learn new technologies while working on this project to be able to get the functions that I wanted to work the way I intended. These include Ajax, Javascript, Jquery, and CSS.


I would like to give proper credit to https://html5up.net/ they provide multiple free to use frontend designs to be used by the public free of charge. I used a template called EscapeVelocity and edited it according to how I preferred. 

## Features
Ability to add and delete skills through RESTful endpoints handled through AJax.
Ability to update resume through RESTful endpoints handled through Ajax.
Provides admin the ability to view list of skills through admin portal. 
Email functionality through Spring Mail that sends emails through gmail.
Direct links to personal projects.
